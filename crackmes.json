        "desc": "CuteGenMe is an aesthetically pleasing, yet deceptively difficult keygen challenge designed to put your reverse engineering skills to the test!\n\nCuteGenMe is built using Rust with Tauri and special care was taken to ensure NO strings are present in the codebase to further increase the difficulty of the challenge. More about this in the spoilers section.\n\nThere are two success routes for this challenge patching or for those who want a real challenge valid key generation.\n\nPatching route:\nThere are detection methods in place to detect if you went the patching route. If detected the challenge will display a unique victory screen, however you will be encouraged to try the valid key generation route.\n\nValid key generation route:\nNavigate the complex key verification algorithm and generate a valid key. More information in the spoilers section.\n\n\nThis is not a beginner-friendly challenge. It requires solid understanding of reverse engineering concepts and will test your ability to understand complex algorithms and implementations.\n\nCan you unravel the mysteries of CuteGenMe and generate valid keys? Accept the challenge and find out!\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nMade with love by uwuowo\n\n---------------SPOILERS---------------\n\n\nKeys are hardware based, time sensitive, and go through several cryptographic transformations. Red herrings are present to make debugging and reversing more challenging.\n\nInstead of a string for valid characters for keys, a byte array of valid characters is used. It is defined as such:\n\n```\nconst CHARSET: &amp;[u8] = b\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&amp;*()_+\";\n```\n\nKeys go through an 11 step verification process, however the Achilles heel lies within the key verification process. In order to ensure your time sensitive hardware based key is valid, the application self tests and generates valid keys for the time window to test against. Due to this generated keys are valid for approximately 15 seconds.\n\nExamples of valid keys:\nq%9qMviqxl7yhj)2pc+^cgjfaY7S3pjCCAc!Ox*+OaK$(shNyELayRr$wzCYs!V0\nuL23opC&amp;xpDYtxv@sDfVUc4L2@6((lT)vWSy6OuL7peQKzDfp1n(KZg+Xy2gnyTR\nxoD*eZC+Cq*&amp;nX*E+hjGlduAr^dvu&amp;rndzsR_iZ_vXVw8*DmaMbz9Cwmpsbaz8vz\nx3ousdvCi3LcmsvLmoBKhaQKJoKVxk$mN^dvya45SopC#^dD%neGt!pWa!fF07Mm\n1zQczmJCDFD3gPWTzMIcsRMCVb!%DqkmJMDkH)j)A6odKM8wEyhOzYxaE69w#uG9\n\n---------------SPOILERS---------------",

I have returned with a re-implemented version my original \"Levels Keygen!\" Crackme in a more visually appealing way (now featuring multiple functions!) This zip packages solutions & hints for levels 1-3, I'm leaving level 4 to be solved by some other awesome reverser, (could it be you?) I'm sorry in advance for the pain it may bring you, & if you want to do a write-up for the whole crackme, be my guest. \n\n\nBefore I hand this crackme off to the world I would like to personally thank the reversers who provided comments & solutions to my previous crackme (& thank all the reversers who suffer through it after).\n\n[Hall of winners!]\ncoldmayo\nIrval\nAttilaTheHun\n\nThe two write-up solutions that I got really put a smile on my face & I'm glad you were able to complete it, so again, thank you.\n\nThis will probably be the last levels-oriented Crackme that I write. I think I've suffered enough programming this to have developed a philosophy on how I should be writing new Crackmes from now on. Single level, fun & interesting high quality concept, introduce something new.\n\nI wish the best of luck to anyone who may try this out, In a few days, I mightt provide hints for level 4 if no one has indicated that it has been solved in the comments.\n\nIf you find any bugs, please report them in the comments, I can't really do anything about it.. But it would make me a better programmer & hopefully not occur again in the next Crackme.\n\nI'm more than willing to give out the source code for this if anyone wants it, just ask in the comments and I'll provide a link within a reasonable time (hopefully).\n\nAll the best, Reverser.\n\n- Mac",

Just start your RE without having to care about unpacking the executable\n\nRules:\nNo patching or modifying in the higher levels.\n\nLevel 1 (Very very easy):\nPatch the program to be always registered\n\nLevel 2 (Hard):\nFind the correct Key\n\nLevel 3 (Very hard):\nWrite a devirtualizer for the instructions\n\nGood luck and let me know if you want a second version.",

In both cases, you are asked not just to reverse engineer the binary, but also to break a leaky cryptographic algorithm.\n\nIn order for a solution to be considered valid, you must actually beat the challenges. Patching does not count, nor does obtaining the flag through other means. I've given you lots of time in case you come up with a brute-force type of solution. However, simple and fast solutions to both challenges are possible! Either way, I would love to see what you come up with, so please post solutions! Not in the comments, though.\n\nWritten in C, with parts written in assembler. Note, this challenge uses avx2 and rdrand instructions, so if your processor does not have these instructions you won't be able to run the crackme.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nsha256: 27ff69fa31ee52439906edee4412a7b5c331179f20887b182587dd5f2508b9f0 cryptoleaks\n",
